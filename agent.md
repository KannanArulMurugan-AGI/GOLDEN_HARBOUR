## ðŸ“Œ Project: E-Commerce Platform (Web )

This project is an **E-Commerce system** where sellers broadcast their products, availability, and prices, and consumers can interact, pre-book, and get real-time notifications.
The backend is powered by **Firebase**, and the frontend is built with **Kombai + Cursor AI (Coding Assistant)**. Developer agents (Jules, OpenSWE, Kombai, Firebase Studio) are used for productivity.
