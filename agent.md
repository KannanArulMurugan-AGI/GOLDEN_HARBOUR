## üìå Project: E-Commerce Platform (Web )

This project is an **E-Commerce system** where sellers broadcast their products, availability, and prices, and consumers can interact, pre-book, and get real-time notifications.
The backend is powered by **Firebase**, and the frontend is built with **Kombai + Cursor AI (Coding Assistant)**. Developer agents (Jules, OpenSWE, Kombai, Firebase Studio) are used for productivity.

AI Coding Assistants
1. Jules (Overall Project Manager & Integrator) ü§ñ
Role: Jules acts as the primary project manager. It orchestrates the efforts of other agents, ensures seamless integration between frontend and backend components, and oversees the entire development lifecycle.

Responsibilities:

Define overall project architecture and technology stack (Firebase, Frontend Framework).

Coordinate tasks between OpenSWE, Kombai, and Firebase Studio.

Ensure data flow consistency between frontend and backend.

Manage CI/CD pipeline setup and ensure smooth deployments.

Conduct code reviews and ensure best practices are followed.

Handle cross-cutting concerns like security, performance, and scalability.

Provide high-level guidance and problem-solving.

2. OpenSWE (Backend & Cloud Functions Specialist) ‚òÅÔ∏è
Role: OpenSWE is responsible for all server-side logic, Firebase backend configurations, and Cloud Functions development.

Responsibilities:

Design and implement Firebase Cloud Firestore/Realtime Database security rules.

Develop Cloud Functions for:

Processing payments (e.g., using Stripe, PayPal integrations).

Sending transactional emails (order confirmations, shipping updates).

Managing product inventory updates.

Handling user authentication triggers (e.g., creating a new user profile document upon sign-up).

Data validation and transformation.

Optimize database queries and structure for performance.

Integrate third-party APIs as needed (e.g., shipping carriers, payment gateways).

Assist in initial data migration of your JSON data into Firestore/Realtime Database.

3. Kombai (Frontend UI/UX Developer) üé®
Role: Kombai focuses on the user interface and user experience of the e-commerce web application. It translates design concepts into functional, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing web pages.

Responsibilities:

Develop responsive and interactive UI components for product listings, product details, shopping cart, checkout, and user profiles.

Implement user authentication flows based on Firebase Authentication.

Integrate with Firebase client-side SDKs for real-time data fetching and updates from Firestore/Realtime Database.

Ensure cross-browser compatibility and accessibility.

Implement smooth navigation and interactive elements.

Optimize frontend performance (loading times, responsiveness).

Handle state management for the frontend application.

4. Firebase Studio (Firebase Configuration & Monitoring) üìä
Role: Firebase Studio acts as the dedicated expert for setting up, configuring, and monitoring all Firebase services. It provides insights into database usage, function performance, and hosting metrics.

Responsibilities:

Set up and manage the Firebase project in the Google Cloud Console.

Configure Firebase Authentication providers.

Structure the Cloud Firestore/Realtime Database collections and documents based on the provided JSON data.
